Foundation Quick Start
****************************

1) Install the package

2) Include the Lobby and Gameplay scenes in the Build Settings


3) Edit the configuration files located in /Assets/Foundation/Resources
	- These configuration files may be in JSON or CSV format.
	- Templates and instructions are included as comments in the configuration file
	- Example changes would include adding any application keys or adding level data

	
4) Register For Cloud / Network
	By default Foundation utilizes the Unity Network for multiplayer and Foundation
	Cloud for cloud services (accounts / high scores / profiles). 
	
	Unity Network requires no configuration on your part. 
	
	Foundation Cloud is a free to start service which requires application registration.
	Register at http://mmofoundation.com . Once registered include your application and 
	private key in the CloudConfig.txt configuration file.

5) Augment the UI
	Foundation uses the new uGUI toolkit. Once you are comfortable with how I did the UI,
	please feel free to replace the layout and sprites with your own.

	It is recommended that you create a new "Lobby" scene so that when I update the package
	example scene my changes will not override yours.

6) Change Services
	Foundation has a plug in architecture. Simply put it was designed so that you could
	switch between network and cloud providers with minimal changes to your code.
	
	Currently our service providers are limited to Unity Network, Foundation Cloud, Photon
	and Realtime.co. I may or may not expand on this depending on requests and sales.

	If you would like to change providers, documentation may be included in this directory.
