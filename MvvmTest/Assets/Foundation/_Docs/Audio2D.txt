Foundation : Audio2d System
****************************

UI scenes often have audio components. If the Main camera moves, these audio sources can become distant.
This Audio system solves this issue by spawning sub listeners to the main camera that components may publish sounds to.

****************************
Use
****************************

- Attach Audio2DListener to the main camera(s)
- Use Audio2DSource for global (ui) sounds. Use just like the AudioSource.
- Use AudioRegulator to regulate audio volume by layers (music, ui, fx, ect)
- Use AudioRegulatorConfig to setup audio layer volumes, (or make an options menu)
- Call Audio2DListener.Instance.Play() and .PlayUI() to play sounds from componenets
