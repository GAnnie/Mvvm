Foundation Read-me
****************************

Welcome and thank you for choosing us. Foundation is a pretty big toolkit involving every aspect
of game development - from uGUI databinding to Cloud Services. 

Documentation is divided up by service in the /Assets/Foundation/_Docs folder. Most of the documents
are ment to be read out of order as basic system references. 

For example Tasks.txt is a reference on how to use the threading / task library included with 
Foundation. While it is not necessary to know about tasks per say, It is recommended that you 
if you want to customize Foundation or write awesome multithreaded games.

Lastly, this toolkit plugs into a number of cloud service providers. For the most part Foundation
seeks to provide a graphical front end for these services only. If you have trouble with a provider
(say photon) I will try to help, but, most likely I would have to refer you to them.
